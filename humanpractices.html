                          From its very inception, Edinburgh iGEM 2015 has been steeped in controversy. What makes our team truly unique, however, is the way in which we have not shied away from its presence, but rather embodied it as the cornerstone of the work we strive to build. </p>

                      With controversy comes important questions. Many have asked whether our test would implicitly condone drug use, and this has opened up a fascinating exploration into the moral implications of harm reduction. Consequently, we have become facilitators of a debate regarding the nature of responsible drug policy, which we believe is paramount to a city so stricken by drug use as the one we have come to know, love, and call home. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Internally, this debate is at once restraining and liberating: it constantly forces us to stop and reevaluate what is the best next step forward, as we attempt to balance seemingly disparate beliefs even within our own group. Yet, by doing so, we come to learn so much about ourselves, as we begin to uncover ingrained prejudices we never knew existed.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As we progress, we realise that there are endless ways in which our narrative could unfold. Indeed, with each new chapter there will be an outside audience who stands and applauds with approval, and one which remains seated and scorns with discontent. Who will belong to which audience is difficult to say; however, one thing is certain: we are the authors, and it is our story to tell.

                                        In order to determine the focus of iGEM 2015, we participated in a week long sandpit where we brainstormed ideas. By the end of the week, we were left with three prospective projects: sound-sensitive "dancing" bacteria, wound detecting-plasters, and a heroin purity biosensor. Put to a democratic vote, the heroin biosensor pulled the majority; however, serious reservations remained widespread amongst the group. 
                                        <br>

                                        Indeed, while iGEM projects that attempt to "save the world" are met with little ethical opposition, it seemed that an iGEM team that tried to tackle a subject as taboo as drug use would meet resistance every step of the way. Nevertheless, we took the idea forward, perhaps driven by the romantic mantra “Edinburgh iGEM 2015: keeping drug addicts alive long enough to recover”. Thus, it was time to get out in the real world and see whether this ideal was made of stone or sand.
                                        <br>

                                        We left the sandpit with interesting thoughts regarding the design of, and biology behind, our putative biosensor. In the case of design, we first imagined a device similar to that of a Gameboy with a biosensor as its processor: users would input a sample of their heroin and the device would output a simple text-based estimate of how much a user could inject without expecting to overdose.
                                        <br>

                                        As far as the biology, we knew we roughly had two options: we could construct either a cell-based or cell-free biosensor. Having a rough idea of the potential benefits and disadvantages of both, we set off on a mission to research the most viable option.
