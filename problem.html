                       <p class="intro-text">
                          From its very inception, Edinburgh iGEM 2015 has been steeped in controversy. What makes our team truly unique, however, is the way in which we have not shied away from its presence, but rather embodied it as the cornerstone of the work we strive to build. </p>
                          <!--
                          <br>
                          With controversy comes important questions. Many have asked whether our test would implicitly condone drug use, and this has opened up a fascinating exploration into the moral implications of harm reduction. Consequently, we have become facilitators of a debate regarding the nature of responsible drug policy, which we believe is paramount to a city so stricken by drug use as the one we have come to know, love, and call home. 
                          <br>
                          Internally, this debate is at once restraining and liberating: it constantly forces us to stop and reevaluate what is the best next step forward, as we attempt to balance seemingly disparate beliefs even within our own group. Yet, by doing so, we come to learn so much about ourselves, as we begin to uncover ingrained prejudices we never knew existed.
                          <br>
                          As we progress, we realise that there are endless ways in which our narrative could unfold. Indeed, with each new chapter there will be an outside audience who stands and applauds with approval, and one which remains seated and scorns with discontent. Who will belong to which audience is difficult to say; however, one thing is certain: we are the authors, and it is our story to tell.

        <h2>Changing views </h2>
        <p>Class-A-fiED aims to take drugs out of the shadows, to facilitate a conversation, and recognise that this is an important issue that needs addressing. We do not want drug users to stay "Classified" - hidden away, too afraid to seek help, we want to communicate an important message - stay safe and recover. </p>

The true figures may greatly exceed the published ones. Many slip under the radar. Drugs affect every aspect of society - health, medicine, crime, economics, education, social inequality, law, family life. In this project though we want to go down to the core of the issue.</p>
